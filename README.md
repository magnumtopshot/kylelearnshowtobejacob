# Quests for Flow: Zero-to-Jacob by Jacob Tucker and Emerald DAO

## Chapter 1 - Day 1 - Learning Blockchain Concepts 

### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

#### Blockchain is sort of a public database where everyone can interact and see what is happening. Think of it the same way like a public library where canyone can store and view data on it! Nobody owns the blockchain!

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.

#### Smart contracts are similar to real life contracts. Think of it as a line of code that developers make. Once deployed on the blockchain, these smart contracts allow users to interact with the blockchain! Similar to real life contracts, no one can change it or tamper with it once it is there.

### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

#### A script is used to view the data on the blockchain, while a transaction is used to transact or make changes on the blockchain. Scripts does not cost money or "gas", while a transaction does.

## Chapter 1 - Day 2 - The Flow Blockchain & Cadence

### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

#### 1. Safety and Security - Cadence maximizes efficiency by making sure that each smart contract is secure while maintaining the highest levels of safety and security
#### 2. Clarity - Each code should be easy to read and understand, so that developers and non-developers alike can easily understand the code.
#### 3. Approachability - Cadence is easy to approach and understand no matter what programming language you are coming from.
#### 4. Developer Experience - Cadence is developer friendly and makes it easy for developer's to debug or correct mistakes found in the code. 
#### 5. Resource Oriented Programming - This is important since it makes the owner of a token directly own the NFT or asset. You do not need to look in a central ledger or database to see if you own something. Similar to physical things, the ownership is represented directly by possessing the item.

### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

#### Knowing the five pillars is standard anywhere - not just in blockchain or coding. By making it easy to understand, the curve to learn is drastically lessened and that it makes things easier to be built.
