## Chapter 1 - Day 1 - Learning Blockchain Concepts 

### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words.

#### Blockchain is sort of a public database where everyone can interact and see what is happening. Think of it the same way like a public library where canyone can store and view data on it! Nobody owns the blockchain!

### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is.

#### Smart contracts are similar to real life contracts. Think of it as a line of code that developers make. Once deployed on the blockchain, these smart contracts allow users to interact with the blockchain! Similar to real life contracts, no one can change it or tamper with it once it is there.

### 3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

#### A script is used to view the data on the blockchain, while a transaction is used to transact or make changes on the blockchain. Scripts does not cost money or "gas", while a transaction does.
